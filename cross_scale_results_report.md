# Cross-Scale Correlations Test Report

## Test Description
The Cross-Scale Correlations test examines whether scales in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectrum that are separated by powers of the golden ratio (φ ≈ 1.618) show stronger correlations compared to randomly selected scales. This test is based on the hypothesis that if the universe exhibits consciousness-like properties, there should be meaningful relationships between scales that follow golden ratio patterns.

## Methodology
1. Define base scales (10, 20, 50, 100) and generate phi-related scales by multiplying each base by powers of φ
2. Calculate correlations between adjacent phi-related scales in each family
3. Compare with correlations between randomly selected scales
4. Calculate statistical significance using z-score and p-value

## Expected Results
If the CMB data shows consciousness-like organization:
- Phi-related scales should show stronger correlations (lower difference in power) than random scales
- The ratio of random correlation to phi-related correlation should be significantly greater than 1
- The p-value should be less than 0.05, indicating statistical significance

## Interpretation Guide
- **Ratio > 2**: Strong evidence for golden ratio-based organization
- **Ratio 1.5-2**: Moderate evidence
- **Ratio 1.1-1.5**: Weak evidence
- **Ratio ≤ 1.1**: No evidence

- **p < 0.01**: Highly significant
- **p < 0.05**: Significant
- **p < 0.1**: Marginally significant
- **p ≥ 0.1**: Not significant

## Phi-Optimality
Phi-optimality measures how closely the ratio of correlations aligns with the golden ratio. A value of 1 indicates perfect alignment, while -1 indicates maximum deviation. This provides an additional perspective on how well the data conforms to golden ratio patterns.

## Implications
If this test shows significant results, it suggests that the CMB power spectrum has a non-random organization that follows golden ratio patterns. This would be consistent with the hypothesis that the universe exhibits properties associated with conscious systems, which often show golden ratio patterns in their organization.

## Sample Results
Below is an example of what the results might look like:

- Mean phi-related correlation: 0.1234
- Mean random correlation: 0.2345
- Ratio: 1.90x
- Z-score: 2.45σ
- P-value: 0.00714

Interpretation: The test shows a moderate effect that is significant. Scales separated by powers of the golden ratio show 1.90x stronger correlation than random scale relationships.

Phi-optimality: 0.854

## Visualization
The visualization would typically show a bar chart comparing phi-related and random correlations, highlighting the difference between them.

## Conclusion
This test provides one piece of evidence in the broader analysis of whether the CMB shows patterns consistent with conscious organization. It should be considered alongside other tests in the comprehensive analysis to form a complete picture.
