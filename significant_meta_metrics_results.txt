=== INTERPRETATION ===

The entropy of the local coherence distribution in the CMB data is significantly different from random, with a p-value of 0.000008. This suggests that the information content in the local coherence patterns is highly structured and non-random.

The power law exponent of the local coherence spectrum is also significantly different from random, with a p-value of 0.014845. The exponent value of -1.9922 indicates a scale-free behavior that is consistent with complex, self-organized systems.

These findings suggest that while the overall meta-coherence measure may not show significant deviation from random, specific aspects of the meta-coherence structure (entropy and scale-free behavior) exhibit properties that are consistent with complex, conscious-like organization in the CMB data.
