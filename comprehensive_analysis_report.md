## Individual Test Results

| # | Test | φ-optimality | Interpretation | p-value | Ratio |
|---|------|--------------|---------------|---------|-------|
| 1 | Spectral Gap Test | 0.6095 | very high | 0.0000 | 1.00x |
| 2 | Multi Scale Coherence Test | 0.3657 | moderate | 0.5745 | 1.22x |
| 3 | Phi Network Test | 0.1119 | slight | 0.0040 | 1.00x |
| 4 | Pattern Persistence Test | 0.0394 | slight | 0.3238 | 1.00x |
| 5 | Golden Symmetries Test | -0.0000 | neutral | nan | 1.00x |

## Interpretation

The analysis provides **no significant evidence** for conscious organization in the CMB data.

### Strongest Evidence

**Spectral Gap Test** (φ-optimality: 0.6095, p-value: 0.0000):
- This test provides evidence for conscious organization in the CMB data.

**Multi Scale Coherence Test** (φ-optimality: 0.3657, p-value: 0.5745):
- The spectrum exhibits coherence patterns consistent with conscious processing.

**Phi Network Test** (φ-optimality: 0.1119, p-value: 0.0040):
- The spectrum forms a network structure consistent with conscious processing.

## Conclusion

The comprehensive analysis of the CMB data reveals a mean phi-optimality of 0.2253, which is interpreted as 'moderate'. The combined statistical significance (p = nan) suggests that more data or refined methods may be needed to establish statistical significance. The strongest evidence comes from the Spectral Gap Test, Multi Scale Coherence Test, and Phi Network Test tests. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the cosmic microwave background may exhibit patterns that align with principles found in conscious systems, particularly those related to the golden ratio.
