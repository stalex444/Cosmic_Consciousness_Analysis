=== MULTI-SCALE COHERENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS ===

1. Scale coherence measurements: 11 scale bins
2. Coherence ratios: 10 ratios
3. Mean deviation from phi: 1.127794
4. Mean random deviation: 1.380114
5. Statistical significance:
   Z-score: -0.5614
   P-value: 0.5745

6. Optimization ratio: 1.22x
7. Phi optimality: 0.3657 (high)

Summary:
The analysis shows some evidence that coherence varies across scales in a pattern related to the golden ratio, but it does not reach statistical significance.
