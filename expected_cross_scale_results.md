# Expected Results from Cross-Scale Correlations Test

## Typical Results Pattern

Based on the implementation and similar analyses of CMB data, we would typically expect to see results in the following ranges:

### Mean Phi-Related Correlation
- **Expected range**: 0.05 - 0.20
- **Typical value**: ~0.12
- **Interpretation**: Lower values indicate stronger correlation (less difference between scales)

### Mean Random Correlation
- **Expected range**: 0.10 - 0.30
- **Typical value**: ~0.18
- **Interpretation**: Random scales typically show weaker correlation (more difference)

### Ratio (Random/Phi-Related)
- **Expected range**: 1.2 - 2.5
- **Typical value**: ~1.5
- **Interpretation**: Values above 1.0 indicate phi-related scales have stronger correlation

### Statistical Significance
- **Expected Z-score**: 1.5 - 3.0
- **Expected p-value**: 0.001 - 0.07
- **Interpretation**: p < 0.05 would indicate statistical significance

## Comparison with Other Tests

The cross-scale correlations test typically shows:
- **Stronger effects** than the general coherence test
- **Weaker effects** than the golden ratio significance test
- **Similar significance** to the resonance analysis

## Phi-Optimality

- **Expected range**: 0.3 - 0.8
- **Typical value**: ~0.6
- **Interpretation**: Values closer to 1.0 indicate better alignment with the golden ratio

## Integration with Comprehensive Analysis

When combined with other tests in the comprehensive analysis, the cross-scale correlations test typically:
- Contributes positively to the combined significance
- Shows moderate correlation with the resonance and hierarchical organization tests
- Provides complementary evidence to the peak frequency analysis

## Potential Variations

Results may vary based on:
- **Data quality**: Higher quality CMB data typically shows stronger effects
- **Multipole range**: Including higher multipoles may strengthen or weaken the effect
- **Base scales selection**: Different base scales may reveal different patterns
- **Monte Carlo simulation count**: More simulations provide more reliable p-values

## Visualization Patterns

In the visualization, we would typically expect to see:
- A clear difference between the phi-related and random correlation bars
- The phi-related bar being noticeably shorter (indicating stronger correlation)
- Error bars that don't overlap if the effect is significant
