=== TRANSFER ENTROPY ANALYSIS RESULTS ===

1. Phi-based scales transfer entropy: 8.834354
2. Random scales transfer entropy: 0.118128
3. Transfer entropy ratio: 74.79x
4. Statistical significance:
   Z-score: 63.2291
   P-value: 0.0000

5. Phi optimality: 1.0000 (extremely high)

Summary:
The analysis shows significant information transfer across scales following golden ratio patterns in the CMB data.
The phi-based scales show higher transfer entropy than random scales, suggesting that the golden ratio pattern facilitates information transfer across scales.
Phi optimality: 1.0000 (extremely high)
